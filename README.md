# Password Generator
My code is free code, which was written in python, and after having hacked all my social networks, and suffering for not having such an elaborate password, I decided to create a file in python.

Can be applied to: 
* Social Media
* Emails 
* Profiles.

About usage, the user just chooses how many digits he would like his password to be, which will generate a password according to the digits in which the user chose.
